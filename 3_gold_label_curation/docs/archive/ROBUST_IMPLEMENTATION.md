# ACSES Pilot Study - Robust Implementation Update

## 🚨 Critical Issues Fixed

Your concerns about the original code were absolutely valid! Here's what was wrong and how it's been fixed:

### ❌ **Original Problems**

1. **Data Loss Risk**: Used `'w'` mode which overwrote entire file each time
2. **No Resume Capability**: If interrupted, you'd have to start completely over
3. **Memory Issues**: Kept all results in memory before writing
4. **Resource Exhaustion**: No protection against API quota/interruptions

### ✅ **New Robust Solution**

## 📊 **JSONL Format Implementation**

**What is JSONL?**
- **JSON Lines**: One JSON object per line
- **Append-only**: Each result is immediately written and never lost
- **Resume-friendly**: Can continue exactly where you left off
- **Memory efficient**: No need to keep everything in memory

**Example JSONL file:**
```jsonl
{"sample_id": 0, "run_number": 1, "is_correct": true, "confidence_score": 0.95}
{"sample_id": 0, "run_number": 2, "is_correct": true, "confidence_score": 0.89}
{"sample_id": 0, "run_number": 3, "is_correct": false, "confidence_score": 0.72}
{"sample_id": 1, "run_number": 1, "is_correct": true, "confidence_score": 0.91}
```

## 🔄 **Resume Capability**

### How It Works:
1. **Startup Check**: Script loads existing JSONL file (if any)
2. **Progress Tracking**: Identifies which sample_id + run_number combinations are complete
3. **Smart Skipping**: Only processes missing runs
4. **Immediate Saving**: Each API call result is saved instantly

### Resume Scenarios:
- **Power outage**: Just run the script again
- **Network interruption**: Continue from exact point
- **API quota exceeded**: Resume when quota resets
- **Manual interruption**: Ctrl+C and restart anytime

## 📈 **Progress Tracking Examples**

```bash
🔄 Checking for existing results...
📂 Found 1,247 existing results
📊 Completed runs: 1,247

📊 Progress Summary:
Total samples: 2,268
Expected total runs: 6,804  (2,268 × 3 runs)
Already completed runs: 1,247
Remaining runs: 5,557

Processing sample 416/2,268: 10130 (ID: 415)
  📋 Need to complete runs: [2, 3]  # Run 1 already done
  Run 2/3... ✅ (1.2s) [Saved]
  Run 3/3... ✅ (0.9s) [Saved]
```

## 🛡️ **Error Handling & Recovery**

### Robust Error Management:
```python
# Each result is saved immediately
try:
    result = call_api(prompt)
    save_result_to_jsonl(result, output_path)  # ← IMMEDIATE SAVE
    print("✅ (1.2s) [Saved]")
except Exception as e:
    error_record = create_error_record(sample, e)
    save_result_to_jsonl(error_record, output_path)  # ← ERROR ALSO SAVED
    print("❌ Error logged and saved")
```

### What Happens During Interruptions:
- **Keyboard Interrupt (Ctrl+C)**: Graceful shutdown message
- **Network Issues**: Individual API calls fail but progress is saved
- **System Crash**: All completed results are preserved
- **API Quota**: Errors logged, resume when quota resets

## 🔧 **Updated Scripts Overview**

### 1. **`03a_run_pilot_study.py`** - Main Script
**New Features:**
- ✅ JSONL output format (`.jsonl` extension)
- ✅ Resume capability with progress tracking
- ✅ Immediate result saving (no data loss)
- ✅ Smart skipping of completed runs
- ✅ Comprehensive error logging
- ✅ Environment variable loading from `.env`

### 2. **`convert_to_jsonl.py`** - Migration Tool
**Purpose:** Convert existing JSON files to JSONL format
```bash
python src/convert_to_jsonl.py
```

### 3. **`analyze_pilot.ipynb`** - Updated Analysis
**New Features:**
- ✅ Automatic JSONL/JSON format detection
- ✅ Backward compatibility with old JSON files
- ✅ Enhanced progress tracking analysis

### 4. **`03b_run_multi_model_pilot.py`** - Multi-Model Runner
**Updated:**
- ✅ Works with new JSONL format
- ✅ Environment variable support

## 🎯 **Migration Guide**

### If You Have Existing JSON Results:
1. **Convert to JSONL** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python src/convert_to_jsonl.py
   ```

2. **Or continue with JSON** (legacy support maintained)
   - Analysis notebook will auto-detect format

### For New Runs:
1. **Set environment variables**:
   ```bash
   $env:GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
   ```

2. **Run pilot study**:
   ```bash
   python src/03a_run_pilot_study.py
   ```

3. **If interrupted, just run again**:
   - Script automatically resumes
   - No data loss, no duplicate work

## 💡 **Benefits Summary**

  Run 3/3... ❌ Error: Connection timeout

# Network restored - resume script
📊 Progress Summary:
Already completed runs: 2,401  # Run 1 for sample 800 is saved!
Remaining runs: 4,403
