# Resume Logic Fix - Resource Exhausted Error Handling

## Problem Identified

You correctly identified a critical flaw in the resume logic. When the script encountered `ResourceExhausted` errors (quota limits), it was:

1. **Logging the error** ‚úÖ (Good)
2. **Marking the run as "completed"** ‚ùå (Bad)
3. **Not retrying failed runs on resume** ‚ùå (Bad)

This meant that when you resumed the script after hitting quota limits, it would skip the failed runs because they were marked as "completed" even though they failed.

## Root Cause

The issue was in two places:

### 1. Loading Existing Results (`load_existing_results`)
```python
# OLD CODE (WRONG)
completed_runs.add((sample_id, run_num))  # Added ALL runs, including failed ones

# NEW CODE (FIXED)
if result.get('success', False):
    completed_runs.add((sample_id, run_num))  # Only add successful runs
```

### 2. Error Handling in Main Loop
```python
# OLD CODE (WRONG)
except Exception as e:
    # ... save error ...
    completed_runs.add((sample_id, run_num))  # Mark error as "completed"

# NEW CODE (FIXED)
except Exception as e:
    # ... save error ...
    # Don't mark error runs as completed - let them retry on resume
```

## Fix Applied

The fix ensures that:

1. **Only successful runs are marked as "completed"**
2. **Failed runs will be retried on resume**
3. **Error records are still logged for analysis**
4. **Progress tracking shows successful vs failed runs**

## How It Works Now

1. **First Run:**
   - Processes samples and makes API calls
   - Saves successful results immediately
   - Saves error records for failed calls
   - Stops when hitting quota limits

2. **Resume (Second Run):**
   - Loads existing results
   - Only marks successful runs as "completed"
   - Identifies failed runs as needing retry
   - Retries only the failed runs
   - Continues from where it left off

3. **Analysis:**
   - Use `analyze_results.py` to see which runs need retry
   - Clear statistics on success vs failure rates
   - Identifies samples with incomplete runs

## Your Current Situation

Based on your JSONL file, you have:
- ‚úÖ Successful runs for samples 0-9 (rows 1-30 in file)
- ‚ùå Failed runs for samples 10+ due to ResourceExhausted
- üîÑ These failed runs will now be retried when you resume

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for quota reset** (usually 24 hours for free tier)
2. **Run the script again:** `python src/03a_run_pilot_study.py`
3. **It will automatically retry failed runs only**
4. **Use analysis script:** `python src/analyze_results.py`

## Benefits of This Fix

- ‚úÖ **Robust resume capability** - never lose progress
- ‚úÖ **Efficient retrying** - only retry what failed
- ‚úÖ **Complete error logging** - track all failures
- ‚úÖ **Resource-aware** - handles quota limits gracefully
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready** - can handle long-running jobs

This transforms your pilot study from a "restart from scratch" approach to a "resume from failure" approach, which is essential for production data processing pipelines.
